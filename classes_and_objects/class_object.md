class:
a classs is a user-defined data type that serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have. A class can be thought of as a template for creating objects, and it encapsulates data and behavior together.

class also helps in hiding the information (data) and functions from the souside worls , allawing control access on limited data and functions. This is known as encapsulation, which is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming.

=> by default all the member of a class are private.


syntax of class:
class class_name{
    private:
        // data members (attributes)
    public:
        // member functions (methods)
}

// data members :

function declaramation;

// member functions:
